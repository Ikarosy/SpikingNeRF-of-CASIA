# SpikingNeRF: Making Bio-inspired Neural Networks See through the Real

Code implementation for SpikingNeRF-D, which is described in the main text of the paper.  We provide the codes for anything you like. I also have some words in the Declaration part.

## Quick setup

One can follow the DVGO official setup tutorials.  Or, follow our implemented setup procedures:

1. Install PyTorch.  Here, we show the setup on our A100 GPU CentOS server.
   ```
   pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2
   ```

2. Install MMCV:
   ```
   pip install -U openmim
   mim install mmcv==1.7.0
   ```

3. Install torch_scatter.  Here, we show our practice.  First, download torch_scatter-2.1.1+pt20cu117-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl.  Then:
   ```
   pip install torch_scatter-2.1.1+pt20cu117-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
   ```

4. Install Miscs: 

   ```
   cd SpikingNeRF-D
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Prepare datasets.  Download the datasets and place them as described in "Directory structure for the datasets" of the official DVGO repository .

Afther the envronment of DVGO is set up, install SpikingJelly to support spiking neural networks, i.e, SpikingNeRF:

```
pip install spikingjelly
```

## Training

Here is the python command for training a TCP-based SpikingNeRF-D model:

```
python run.py --config configs/nerf_main_condensing/lego.py --render_test
```

In the `configs/nerf_main_condensing`file, besides `lego.py`, we store the configurations for all the other scenes of Synthetic-NeRF.

SpikingJelly sometimes fails to detect CuPy correctly.  In this case, one should switch the backend to torch: In `lib/spiking_dvgo.py`, replace all `backend='cupy'`by `backend='torch'`.

Additionally, the training command for a TP-based SpikingNeRF-D:

```
python run.py --config configs/nerf_main_not_condensing/lego.py --render_test
```

## Evaluation

Here is the python command for evaluating a TCP-based SpikingNeRF-D model:

```
python run.py --config configs/nerf_main_condensing/lego.py --render_test --eval_ssim --render_only --op_count
```

Results of SpikingNeRF-D on this scene will be printed, including PSNR, SSIM, FLOPs, and SOPs.

Correspondingly, TP-based evaluation command:

```
python run.py --config configs/nerf_main_not_condensing/lego.py --render_test --eval_ssim --render_only --op_count
```

## What's more

One can easily re-write the config file (e.g. configs/nerf_main_condensing/lego.py) to reproduce different ablation results, e.g. temporal flip. 
SpikingNeRF-T is the TensoRF based spikingnerf. Just check and understant how to use autorun.py in Spikingnerf-t.
and `python autorun.py`.

## Declaration & Some nonsignificant Personal Complaints （I just failed holding it back）

This project will be updated irregularly until the full version is contained. I run this project all by my own. I would take responsibility of what I said. Do not relate to my affiliation.

I was really pissed by the lying reviewer of AAAI25 I unluckily encountered.  This MF wrote a  bunch of comments that are full of fake evidence and fabricated arguments. In the very beginning, this paper was poorly written and the experiments are not complete. But, after a year of perfection. I got 7/6/3/2 scores in AAAI25. the reviewers who gave me 7/6 recognized the contibution and deemed this work as "solid". The reviewer who gave me 3 had its own insistence on the hardware part (which was wrong and it appeared not familiar with hardware). Fine, I respect it although the guy was unprofessional and low-level. At least, he had his opinion and recognized my originality.

The most ridiculous part came. The guy who gave me 2 points wrote a lot of comments but every words is full of fake evidence, injustice, and fking lies. Swear to GOD, I would love to expose the comment and this MF, if I could. This guy first blame me for not Citing A Paper That Appeared LATER than the AAAI Submission Deadline. BTW, that paper reports worse results than mine. Then, it claimed I used the similar methods of some irrelevant works. However, none of the tricks of those works would even possibly apply to mine. Totally different works. And, I clearly written in the paper and codes that my models are all trained end2end. But, this MF accused me of using the "ANN2SNN conversion" training. It also questioned my experiemts were insufficient, but the expermetal results I gave were more than any of those works it mentioned. I put so many results that the main text could not contain. There were so many other lies. I am not gonna list them all. I will post the full rebuttal if I could someday. 

I am totally open to negative comments. They can help perfect my work. But such toxic lies are driving me fking crazy. It exactly fits the old Chinese saying "欲加之罪何患无辞", just fabricate some crimes and put me in the jail. 

I was so so so pissed.  Why would I suffer such persecution? 

Now, I clearly understand why influential works like Mamba, PACT, would be rejected. Some vicious peers.  Nevertheless, I have to let it go. I am just tired. Need to move on. But,  wont go any further with this project. 11-16,2024.
